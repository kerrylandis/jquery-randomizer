# randomizer
The 2 files in this repo were built based on a project I was working where the client needed content ransomized on page load and images randomized in a different scenario.  I generated these quickly to work with jQuery on the client's site, but the concept can easily be reused.

1. div-randomizer.js - this will look for a series of child divs within a targeted div IDs, randomize them and reloade the sequence using any recent jQuery version.

2. image-randomizer.js - this has 2 varients, but can be modified if only 1 image size is needed where it generates a temp array, randomizes images based on the array length and then sets the image source and dimensions.
